# LEJ Claude Session Board

A Claude Code skill for running a lot of Claude Code sessions in one project without losing track of them.

One session becomes the **manager**. Every other session in the project folder reports to it: when it starts something, when it needs you, before it touches shared code or deploys, and when it's done. The manager keeps one page current, the **LEJ Session Board**. It's a local HTML file in your project folder that reloads itself every minute:

- **An overview up top:** a paragraph on what's happening now and one on what already happened.
- **A collapsed section per open session:** its title and what it needs from you. Urgent sessions come first, then ones with questions, then the rest. Click to open its state, where it stands and its questions.
- **Recommended answers:** each question has two or three options, one marked Recommended, plus **Write your own answer**. Copy puts the session's name and `Re: <question>` above your reply, so the manager knows where it goes. Paste it in the session, or paste a batch back to the manager and it relays each one. **Copy all answers** answers a whole session in one paste.
- **The to-do list:** collapsible groups by who acts. Your-call items come with recommended answers too. Every item Claude can build has a numbered starter prompt (`PRJ5 Short name`) to copy into a new session, title included.
- **Question counts and copy marks:** the header says how many questions need you, and each Copy button turns into "✓ Copied" once used.

The manager also runs the deploy queue (one deploy at a time), hands out migration numbers, keeps session titles in the `PRJ5 Short name` pattern, and catches overlaps between sessions.

It uses Claude Desktop's session tools, so it runs in the **Code tab of the Claude desktop app**.

**Local page vs. artifact:** the board is a local file by default (`LEJ Session Board.html` in your project folder). It can also be published as a claude.ai artifact so you can open it on your phone. Artifact publishes have a daily cap per account, which a busy manager hits by mid-afternoon, so the skill publishes only when you ask and never more than every 15–20 minutes.

## Watch it

A three-minute video of the whole loop (install, make a manager, read the board, answer, start new work), plus a step-by-step guided setup: **[limitededitionjonathan.com/session-board](https://limitededitionjonathan.com/session-board)**. The project in the video is made up; its board data is `assets/demo-data.json`.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justfinethanku/lej-claude-session-board.git ~/.claude/skills/lej-session-board
```

Then in a Claude Code desktop session in your project folder, say something like "be the manager for this folder and make me a session board", or "which of my sessions are stale?"

## What's inside

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` | The instructions Claude follows: roster, hub setup, building the board, keeping it current. |
| `assets/board-template.html` | The board page, rendered from a JSON block. Example data included. |
| `scripts/build_local.py` | Turns the filled template into a standalone page that auto-reloads (60 s, and not while you're typing). |
| `assets/demo-data.json` | The made-up "Pantry" board from the video, with every feature filled in. |
| `references/data-schema.md` | The JSON fields the page reads. |
| `references/coordination-rule.md` | The `CLAUDE.md` block that makes sessions report to the manager. |
